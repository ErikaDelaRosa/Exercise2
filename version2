///*Calculate the three bills including tips: €26.67 + 15% tip. */

//table 2. here i tried to use a function, as it can be reusable, we just add the total bill and the desired tip
function totalBillmath (bill, tip) { 
    let calculateTip = bill * tip / 100; // here i found out how much is the % to be add to total
    console.log(calculateTip);
    let finalBill = bill + calculateTip;
    console.log(Math.floor(finalBill)); // total including the tip 
    }
    totalBillmath(26.67, 15); //this can be reusable
